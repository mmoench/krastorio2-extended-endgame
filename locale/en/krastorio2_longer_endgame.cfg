kee-activations=Number of required transceiver activations
kee-initial-need-space-research=Initial space research data needed for transceiver activation
kee-initial-need-matter-research=Initial matter tech cards needed for transceiver activation
kee-initial-need-advanced-research=Initial advanced tech cards needed for transceiver activation
kee-initial-need-singularity-research=Initial singularity tech cards needed for transceiver activation


[mod-setting-description]
kee-activations=How many tests of the intergalactic transceiver are required before it is activated and you win the game. Each activation requires more energy and the number of resources is doubled (10 is recommended).
kee-initial-need-space-research=With each activation of the intergalactic transceiver the required number of resources is doubled (default is 250, which totals to ~256,000 with 10 activations).
kee-initial-need-matter-research=With each activation of the intergalactic transceiver the required number of resources is doubled (default is 1000, which totals to ~1,024,000 with 10 activations).
kee-initial-need-advanced-research=With each activation of the intergalactic transceiver the required number of resources is doubled (default is 1000, which totals to ~1,024,000 with 10 activations).
kee-initial-need-singularity-research=With each activation of the intergalactic transceiver the required number of resources is doubled (default is 1000, which totals to ~1,024,000 with 10 activations).

[entity-description]
    kee-intergalactic-transceiver-loading=Insert required science data to attempt next activation. [color=red]Caution:[/color] Any excess resources or items will be destroyed uppon activation.
    kee-intergalactic-transceiver-test-fire=Performing test-firing to validate current theories of singularity creation and the integrity of the containment field.

[item-name]
    kee-intergalactic-transceiver-loading=Intergalactic transceiver
    kr-intergalactic-transceiver=Intergalactic transceiver
[item-description]
    kee-intergalactic-transceiver-loading=This building creates a controlled singularity to communicate between galaxies, which is the only way to be rescued from this galaxy. The process of creating a stable and contained singularity is dangerous and requires a huge amount of additional research as well as energy.

    kr-intergalactic-transceiver=__ITEM__kr-intergalactic-transceiver__

[technology-description]
    kr-intergalactic-transceiver=Unlocks the intergalactic transceiver, which creates a singularity to communicate with distant galaxies and wins the game.
